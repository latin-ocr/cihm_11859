LIFE OF CICERO.

Marcus Tullius Cicero was born. on the third day of J anuary,

equestrian rank. Marcus and his brother Quintus received
the rudiments of their education in their father's house.

were taken to Rome, and placed under the best teachers in
the capital. Among their instructore at this time was the
poet Archias. After assuming the toya virilis at sixteen

Cicero served as a soldier but once--in his 18th year, in
