individua! magistrates, he does it with enthusiasm‚ a splen·

expression which makes us love the man as much as we
admire his genius.'’

“For deliberative eloquence it has been already said that
Cicero was not well fitted, since on great questions of state it

‘is not so much the orator’s fire or even his arguments that

move as the authority that attaches to his person. And in
this lofty source of influence Cicero was deficient. Cicero
was always applauded3 men like Crassus, Pompey, or Paesar,
were followed.” ι

“Even in his own special department of judicial eloquence,
Cicero‘s mind was not able to cope with the great principles
of law ..... Without any firm basis of opinion he was
compelled to judge questions by the results which he could
foresee at the moment, and by the floating popular standard,
to which, as an advocate, he had naturally turned.’' -

“ In nothing is Cicero more conspicuous than in his clear
and life-like descriptionS. His portraits are photographic.
..... His power of description is equalled by the
readiness of his wit. Raillery, banter, sarcasxn, jest‚ irony,—
light and grave, the whole artillery of wit, is always at his
command. . . . . His chief faults are exaggeration,
vanity‚ and an inordinate love of words. The former is at
once a conscious rhetorical artifice, and an unconscious effect
of his vehement and excitable temperament, His vanity is
more deplorable 3 and the only palliation it admits is the fact

, that it is a defect which rarely goes with a bad heart. His

wordiness is of all his faults the most seductive and the most
conspicuous, and procured for him, even iu his life-time, the
epithet of Asiacic ...... His wealth of illustration
chokes the idea, as creepers choke the forest tree.”
