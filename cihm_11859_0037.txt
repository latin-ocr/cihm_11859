  

THE CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.

  
    

Lucius Sergius Catilina was a man of noble birth, but of
the most vicious character. From his earliest youth he took
pleasure in vice and crime. He was dai-ing and cunning;
covetous, and yet prodigal ; violent in his passions ; immoder-
ately ambitious. He was always a terror to constituted
authority, but his want of practical sagacity saved the state
on more than one occasion. He first came into notice as a
zealous and cruel partizan of Sulla. He hold the office of
praetor in ΒΟ. 68. He was governor of Africa in B.C. 67.
He was a candidate for the consulship for the year 65, v
but he was disqualified by an impeachment for oppression in
his government of Africa. Thereupon he formed a project
with Piso and Autronius to murder the consuls Torquatus
and Cotta in the Capitol on the lst of J anuary. This scheme
miscarried, as Catiline himself gave the signal prematurely
before a sufficient number of his associates had assembled.
He was not disheartencd by the failure, but at once set to
work to organize a more extensive conspiracy. This second
plot was the famous Conspiracy of Catiline.

There were at'this time many men in Rome, especially
among the younger nobility‚ who had lost their fortunes, and
to whom was welcome any change that might relieve their
desperate condition. Among these were some of senatorian
rank,-—P. Cornelius Lentulus, P. Autronius, L. Cassius
Longinus, C. Cethegus, P. Sulla ancl S. Sulla (nephews of
the dictator), L. Vargunteius, Q. Annius, M. Porcius Laeca,
L. Bestia, Q. Curius. The equestrian order was represented
