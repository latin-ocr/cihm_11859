PREFAGE.

In one of Cicero’s many confidential letters to his friend
Atticus he asks, “ What will history say of me six hundred
years hence? '' Thrice six hundred years have flown and his-
tory still vacillates between senseless censure and sycophan-
tish praise regarding Cicero the statesman : regarding Cicero
the orator the almost universal verdict is, and has ever been,
-mz'cat incer omnes velut inter ignes Luna minores. Every
succeeding generation acquiesces in the judgment of the pre-
ceding and adds the weight of its authority to the ever

accumulating glcry of the illustrious Roman. Without' the

charin of his living voice, without the subtle spell of his
urbanity and persoual magnetism, Cicero still by the clo-
qucnce of the silent page holds undisputeu sway in the

rcalrns of oratory.

The Catilinarian speeches have always been regarded with
peculiar favor, both on account of their intrinsic merit and
on account of the thrilling interest of the events that pro-
duced them. This little book contains the first of the four

’ speeches‚—one of the prose selections to be read for the next

three years by candidates for University Matriculation and
for Teachers' CertificateS.
