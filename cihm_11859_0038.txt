by M. Fulvius Nobilior, L. Statilius, P. Gabinius, G.
Cornelius. The purpose of Catiline's new scheme was to
overturn the government and to make himself supreme.
The time seemed opportune. The regular armies of Italy
were abi-cad. Pompey was at a distance. The senate was
in a state of careless security. Sulla's veteran soldiers who
had wasted their possessions in wanton luxury were eager for
another civil war. By promising to some an absolution of
their⁸debts, to others the death of their enemies, to others
abundance of plunder‚ Catiline made himself strong. He
determined to make use of the consulship as a stepping-stoxie
to power. He intrigued to have a confederate of his—O.
Antonius —elected as his eolleague. After’ an exeiting canvass
Cicero was elected by a large majority with Antonius as

. associate. ,Catiline's fury was great. He exerted himself

more than ever in the prosecution of his secret designs. He
levied troops in various parts of Italy. He established a
camp near Faesulae in Etruria under Manlius, one of Sulla's
veterans, a bold and experienced officer. Meanwhile Cicero
was apprised of all the details of the conspiracy as soon as
they were formed. The indiscreet and almost indifferent Q.
CuriuS, one of the conspiratorS, made a confidente oi his
mistress, Fulvia, and she could not withhold her secret infor-
mation from the consul.

The senate so long irresolute was at length roused to
action. Cicero and his colleague were granted absolute
power by the passing of the decree “ that the consuls should
take care that the republie received no har1n.’' In B. O. 63
Catiline offered himself again for the consulship of the fol-
lowing year. Through the exertions of Cicero he was again
defeated. He then determined on an immediate outbreak.
The conspirators met on Nov. 61:11 at the house of M. Laeca
