Quom ud finem ε this is almost equivalent to quam diu and
quo usque.

Praesiauim Pamtlz the Palatino was the most central of
the seven hills of Rome and was one of the strougest positione
in the city. On the present occasion it was guarded to prevent
its being seized by the conspirators.

Trace the history of our word ‘palaea' back to Palatium.

Urbis vigiliae ι whenever there was alarin or disturbance in
the city the senate instructed the inferior magist-,ntes to guard
the various streete with armcd forces.

Hic munitissimus etc. The senate usually met in the
Curia Hostilia, but in exigencics like the present it was con-
vencd in some strongly tortified or consecrated place. Tho place
referred-to here was the temple of Jupiter Stator in the Capitol.
Some locate this temple at the foot of the Palatino.

tions.'

Jussu consulis ε about three weeks before this, on Oct. 21st‚
the senate had armed the consuls with special powers by the
formal decree issued in times of peril : Videant} consules ‘ne quid
respublica detrimenti capiat. Under this decree Catilina

might have been put to death. 21
